        <p>Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving
        by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies
        to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
        numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
        brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as
        to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by
        allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
        proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet
        unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be
        found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
        novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger
        Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted
        critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
        of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
        difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
        in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
        delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly
        theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
        wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
        Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might
        very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
        yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and
        others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and
        Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
        not want them.</p>
